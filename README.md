# Weather Application

This weather application is built with React Redux and utilizes the OpenWeatherMap's API to pull in current weather data by searching for cities. 

## Getting Started

```
$ npm install
```

## Using The App

On the main search bar, type in a complete city name and hit the submit button. Complete weather information will populate below the search bar as well as a button with the city weather data above the search bar (for future reference). Enjoy!
